It imparts the yellow colour to curry powder. Largely used in India and other Asian countries in traditional medicine and has many benefits.  Daily intake: Up to 1 mg/kg body weight for curcumin, and 0.3 mg/kg for turmeric.  It is safe for consumption but caution with large quantities, some people can experience nausea or diarrhea. Turmeric can make gallbladder problems worse. Don't use turmeric if you have gallstones or a bile duct obstruction or if you are pregnant because it is an uterine stimulant.

		<p><br>
			Turmeric is an essential flavouring spice of Indian and other cuisine. The Turmeric rhizome provides the typical yellow colour of many curry dishes and helps to make the food more digestible.</p>
		<p>It is also used in product systems that are packaged to protect them from sunlight. The oleoresin is used for oil-containing products. The curcumin / polysorbate solution or curcumin powder dissolved in alcohol is used for water containing products. Over-colouring, such as in pickles, relishes and mustard, is sometimes used to compensate for fading.</p>
		<p>Turmeric has found application in canned beverages, baked products, dairy products, ice cream, yoghurts, yellow cakes, biscuits, popcorn-colour, sweets, cake icings, cereals, sauces, gelatines, direct compression tablets, etc. In combination with Annatto, <a href="http://fake.com/#E160b">E160b</a>, it has been used to colour cheeses, dry mixes, salad dressings, winter butter and margarine.</p>
		<p>Investigations into the low incidence of colo-rectal cancer amongst ethnic groups with a large intake of curries compared with the indigenous population have discovered that some active ingredients of Turmeric appear to have anti-cancer properties. Second stage trials of a Turmeric-based drug to treat cancer are currently underway.</p>

			<p>Riboflavin, also known as Vitamin B2, is an easily absorbed, water-soluble micronutrient with a key role in maintaining human health. Like the other B vitamins, it supports energy production by aiding in the metabolising of fats, carbohydrates and proteins. Vitamin B2 is also required for red blood cell formation and respiration, antibody production, and for regulating human growth and reproduction. It is essential for healthy skin, nails, hair growth and general good health, including regulating thyroid activity.<br>
				<br>
				Riboflavin also helps in the prevention or treatment of many types of eye disorders, including some cases of cataracts. It may assist bloodshot, itching or burning eyes and abnormal sensitivity to light.<br>
				<br>
				Milk, cheese, leafy green vegetables, liver and yeast are good sources of Vitamin B2, but exposure to light will destroy the Riboflavin in these natural sources. Any excess is excreted in the urine but as the human body does not store Riboflavin it is thought deficiency is common.<br>
				<br>
				In processed foods it is very likely to be GM as it can be produced synthetically using genetically modified <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, altered to both increase the bacteria production of riboflavin and to introduce an antibiotic (ampicillin) resistance marker.<br>
				<br>
				Riboflavin is yellow or orange-yellow in colour and in addition to being used as a food colouring it is also used to fortify some foods. It can be found in such foods as baby foods, breakfast cereals, sauces, processed cheese, fruit drinks and vitamin-enriched milk products as well as being widely used in vitamin supplements.<br>
				<br>
				It is difficult to incorporate Riboflavin into many liquid products as it has poor solubility. Hence the requirement for E101a Riboflavin-5'-phosphate, a more expensive but more soluble form of Riboflavin.</p>

Daily intake: Up to 7 mg/kg body weight. Banned in Switzerland. It may elicit intolerance in people intolerant to salicylates. Additionally, it is a histamine liberator, and may intensify symptoms of asthma. In combination with benzoates, it is also implicated in hyperactivity in children. One of its degradation products causes bladder cancer in animals when present in high concentrations.

It has been banned in the United States, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Japan, Finland and Norway. It may elicit intolerance in people intolerant to salicylates. Additionally, it is a histamine liberator, and may intensify symptoms of asthma. In combination with benzoates, it is also implicated in hyperactivity in children. In the intestines, it can be transformed by bacteria into possibly hazardous compounds, hence the rather low ADI and restricted use.

		<p>A naturally occurring silvery-white metal obtained from the ore, bauxite. Because of its chemical activity, aluminium never occurs in the metallic form in nature, but its compounds are present to varying degrees in almost all rocks, vegetation, and animals.</p>
		<p>Despite being the most abundant metallic element, constituting 8.1 percent of the Earth's crust there is no dietary requirement for aluminium.</p>
		<p>Whilst in 1809, the English chemist Sir Humphry Davy had prepared an iron-aluminium alloy by electrolysing fused aluminium oxide and had in fact already named the element, it was not until 1825 that crude aluminium was isolated by the Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian &Oslash;rsted, by reducing aluminium chloride with potassium amalgam.</p>
		<p>The modern method of commercially producing aluminium: electrolysis of purified alumina dissolved in molten cryolite was discovered, almost simultaneously in 1886, by Charles Martin Hall in the United States and Paul-Louis-Toussaint H&eacute;roult in France.</p>
		<p>As a food additive it is used solely for external decoration where it can be found in the covering of drag&eacute;es and the decoration of sugar-coated flour confectionery, in cake decorations and to give a silvery finish to pills and tablets.</p>
		<p>However, it is also added to the tap water drinking supply in some areas to remove discoloration and is widely available in antacid treatments. It can also be ingested from soft drinks in aluminium cans used past their sell-by dates, when the aluminium content of the drink has been found to exceed the limits laid down by the EC for drinking water, and by the use of aluminium pots and pans and cooking utensils.</p>
		<p>There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that an accumulation of aluminium in the cells of the nervous system could be potentially toxic. It is found in abnormally high levels in the brain cells of Alzheimer's disease sufferers, accumulated in the neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, but it is not yet known whether it has a causative or resultant role in the disease.</p>
		<p>Several reports also suggest that a high aluminium intake may have adverse effects on the metabolism of phosphorous and calcium in the human body and may induce or intensify skeletal abnormalities such as osteoporosis.</p>
		<p>Increased urinary excretion of magnesium and calcium has been reported following regular antacid use.<br>

		<p>Occurring naturally in body fluids and plant juices acetic acid, also called ethanoic acid, is the most important of the carboxylic acids. It is an important metabolic intermediate being involved in fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism.</p>
		<p>In one of its most common forms, vinegar, (from the French <i>vin</i>, wine;<i> aigre</i>, sour - giving away its origins), it has been used as a preservative since ancient times.</p>
		<p>Vinegar can be made from any liquid that is capable of being converted into alcohol in a two-step process. During fermentation the sugar in the liquid is converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas by the actions of yeast enzymes. Then, in a process first described by the French physicist Louis Pasteur in 1864, the alcohol then combines with atmospheric oxygen by the action of <i>Acetobacter</i> bacteria, forming acetic acid and water. (Although it was early in the 18th century that a Dutch technologist, Hermann Boerhaave, found that the rate of acid production was directly proportional to the amount of surface exposed to air).</p>
		<p>It is because of the variety of source materials, and the differing organic acids and esters derived from that source material which are also present, that are responsible for the different flavours and aromas of vinegar, for example, grapes - wine vinegar, apples - cider vinegar, malted barley or oats - malt vinegar.</p>
		<p>In addition to the method for producing vinegar, large amounts of acetic acid are prepared synthetically either by acetylene being hydrated to acetaldehyde, which is then oxidized or by a process using methanol, from gas or oil, and carbon monoxide.</p>
		<p>Pure (over 99%) acetic acid, is called glacial acetic acid, and is a corrosive, colourless liquid with a boiling point of 117.9 C. which is completely miscible with water. It is so corrosive that it could burn through the oesophagus and it has been used in products to remove warts and corns.</p>
		<p>In foods it is used for its antibacterial properties, as an acidity stabiliser, diluting colourings, as a flavouring agent and for inhibiting mould growth in bread. In brewing it is used to reduce excess losses of carbohydrate from the germinated barley and to compensate for production variations, so producing a consistent quality beer.</p>
		<p>It can be found in beer, bread, cheese, chutney, horseradish cream, pickles, salad cream, brown sauce, fruit sauce, mint sauce and jelly and tinned baby food, sardines and tomatoes.</p>

		<p>First isolated in 1780 by a Swedish chemist, Carl Wilhelm Scheele, it is usually obtained commercially by heating and fermenting carbohydrates such as sucrose, molasses, starch, or whey.</p>
		<p>As a food additive it increases the antioxidant properties of other substances and can be used to add a bitter taste. In brewing it is used to reduce losses of carbohydrates from germinated barley and for adding to the malt slurry to assist in making a beer of consistent quality.</p>

		<p>&nbsp; Vitamin C, essential for growth, healthy teeth, gums, bones, skin and blood vessels and aiding the absorption of iron, is found naturally in many fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>
		<p>It is commercially manufactured by several different methods, however one in particular should be noted. This involves a fermentation process using the genetic material of two enzymes from different bacteria being transferred to a single bacterium - Genetic Modification.</p>
		<p>It is used as an antioxidant in the brewing industry where it improves the shelf life of beers and prevents haze development, a preservative in the meat industry where it helps maintain colour, an improving agent in the baking industry and also for inhibiting discolouration in cut fruits, fruit pulp and juices.</p>
		<p>In addition to its use in these areas it can also be found in butter, frozen egg products, powdered and concentrated milk, frozen croquette potatoes, tinned baby foods and wine. It can also be added to products that may lose their vitamin C in processing - such as dried potatoes.</p>

		<P>Commercial lecithin, most of which comes from soya bean oil, which may be GM, contains a mixture of phosphoglycerides containing principally lecithin, cephalin and phosphatidyl inositol. Other sources are egg yolk, from where it was originally obtained, and leguminous seeds, including peanuts and maize, which also may be GM. As it can also be obtained from animal fat, vegetarians should be careful.</P>
<P>In cells lecithin protects the membranes and the polyunsaturated fats within the cells from oxygen attack.</P>
<P>As an emulsifier it lowers the surface tension of water allowing the better combining of oils, fats and water in such foods as chocolate, ice cream, margarine and mayonnaise. In bread and bakery products it increases volume and also acts as an anti-staling agent thereby extending shelf life.</P>
<P>In margarine it has the added advantage of preventing water leakage, so preventing spitting when frying, and protecting beta-carotene (<A HREF="<a href="http://fake.com/#E141">E141</a>-<a href="http://fake.com/#E160">E160</a>.html#Anchor-<a href="http://fake.com/#E160a">E160a</a>-23269"><a href="http://fake.com/#E160a">E160a</a></A> Vitamin A). In chocolate it allows a reduction in the cocoa butter content, prevents crystals forming and reduces viscosity (see <A HREF="<a href="http://fake.com/#E471">E471</a>-480.html#Anchor-<a href="http://fake.com/#E476">E476</a>-37448"><a href="http://fake.com/#E476">E476</a></A>). Soya lecithin has the same binding ability as egg yolk lecithin and can be used in place of eggs in many products. It also helps powders mix quickly and easily in milk or water.</P>
<P>Lecithin is also a good synergist to antioxidants in fats and oils so is often used in combination with them.</P>

@FunctionDetails@	Citric acid has many functions; it enhances the activity of many antioxidants, but is no antioxidant by itself. It is mainly used as an acidity regulator as well as aroma compound. It increases gel strength in marmalades and decreases enzymatic browning in fruits and fruit products
@Origin@	Citric acid is a compound found in every living organism, as it is part of the key metabolic pathways in all body cells. Large concentrations are found in citrus fruits, kiwi, strawberries and many other fruits. It is commercially prepared by fermentation of molasses with the mould Aspergillus niger
@MyAdditivesDescription@	White or colourless, odourless, crystalline solid; the monohydrate form effloresces in dry air
@DietaryRestrictions@	Citric acid and citrates can normally be consumed by all religious groups, vegans and vegetarians. Citric acid does not cause allergic reactions in people who are allergic to oranges and citrus fruits, as it is commercially made from sugar, not fruits

		<p align="left">&nbsp; The most versatile and widely used organic acid in foodstuffs, citric acid is a colourless, crystalline organic compound, belonging to the family of carboxylic acids.</p>
		<p align="left">It is present in practically all plants, and in many animal tissues and fluids, but it is in particularly high concentrations in lemons and other citrus juices and many ripe fruits.</p>
		<p align="left">First isolated in 1784 from lemon juice, by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, citric acid has been used as a food additive for over 100 years.</p>
		<p align="left">It is normally manufactured by fermentation of cane sugar or molasses in the presence of the fungus <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, but it can also be obtained from pineapple by-products and low-grade lemons.</p>
		<p>Its use as a food additive is wide and varied - as a synergist to enhance the effectiveness of other antioxidants; as a sharp-tasting flavouring; as a sequestrant in foods it combines with the naturally occurring trace metals to prevent discolouration and in wine production it combines with free iron to prevent the formation of iron-tannin complexes which cause cloudiness; in brewing to reduce excess losses of sugars from the germinated barley; to create an acidic environment to discourage the growth of certain bacteria, yeasts and moulds and in cheese making it produces a faster and more consistent method of producing the necessary acidic environment for the enzyme activity than the traditional souring by lactic acid (<a href="http://fake.com/#E270">E270</a>) caused by bacteria.</p>
		<p>Because of this versatility it can be found in a wide range of products, including non-alcoholic drinks, bakery products, beer, cheese and processed cheese spreads, cider, biscuits, cake mixes, frozen fish (particularly herrings, shrimps and crab), ice cream, jams, jellies, frozen croquette potatoes and potato waffles, preserves, sorbets, packet soups, sweets, tinned fruits, sauces and vegetables and wine.</p>
		<p>Recorded problems are that it can be a local irritant and in large amounts can cause teeth erosion.</p>
		<p>However there have been erroneous reports that it is a major cause of cancer. It is thought that this has been brought about by misunderstanding and confusion over the word Krebs.</p>
		<p>Citric acid is one of a series of compounds involved in the physiological oxidation of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates to carbon dioxide and water.</p>
		<p>This series of chemical reactions, which is central to nearly all metabolic reactions and the source of two-thirds of the food-derived energy in higher organisms was discovered by the German-born British biochemist Sir Hans Adolf Krebs. He actually received the 1953 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery, and as well as being known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (its correct name), it is also known as the citric acid cycle or the Krebs cycle.</p>
		<p>Hence, citric acid is fundamental to the Krebs cycle and Krebs is the German word for cancer!</p>

		A natural, widely occurring, plant acid, giving the strong tart taste and the characteristic flavour to acidic fruits such as grapes, lemons and oranges. In fruit it can be free or either combined with potassium, calcium or magnesium. Sometimes deposited as crystals in wine.
		<p>A dicarboxylic acid, also called dihydroxybutanedioic acid, the free acid was first isolated in 1769 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, although, in a partially purified form tartar was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans.</p>
		<p>Most L-tartaric acid is manufactured as a by-product of the wine industry. The sediments, and other waste products from fermentation are heated and neutralised with calcium hydroxide and then the precipitated calcium tartrate is treated with sulphuric acid to produce free tartaric acid. Can also be extracted from tamarind pulp.</p>
		<p>Tartaric acids and the common tartrate salts are all colourless, crystalline solids readily soluble in water.</p>
		<p>In food it is used as: an antioxidant where as a synergist it increases the antioxidant effect of other substances: for adjusting acidity in frozen dairy products, jellies, bakery products, dried egg whites, sweets, beverages, jams and preserves and wine: diluting food colours: as a sequestrant, chemically combining with undesirable oxidants and rendering them inactive: an acid in some baking powders.</p>
		<p>Can also be found in cocoa powders, sweets and tinned asparagus, fruit and tomatoes.</p>
		<p>Eighty per cent of ingested tartaric acid is destroyed by bacteria in the intestine, with the fraction that is absorbed into the bloodstream being excreted in the urine.</p>

@EverbumDescription@	Glycerol is a natural carbohydrate alcohol, also known as glycerin or glycerine. It is produced synthetically from propylene, or by the bacterial fermentation of sugars. It is used as a thickening agent in liquids, as a filler and bulking agent for low-fat foods, as a humectant in baked goods, as an anti-crystallisation agent in icings and confectionary, and as a sugar substitute. Glycerol is absorbed and metabolised as glucose (by the body) into fats.

		<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="6" color="red"><b><i>E422<br>
					</i></b></font><font size="5" color="red">Glycerol</font></p>
		<p>&nbsp;A clear, colourless, sweet-tasting viscous liquid belonging to the polyhydric alcohol family of organic compounds, occurring naturally in all animal and plant cells, normally as a component of more complex structures, rarely in its free state.</p>
		<p>Since Carl W. Scheele, a Swedish chemist, discovered in 1779 that glycerol could be obtained from olive oil by heating it with lead monoxide it has found thousands of uses covering almost every industry.</p>
		<p>Whether it be synthetic resins or gums, including vehicle enamels and house paints, drugs, serums, vaccines, suppositories, skin lotions, mouthwashes, cough medicines, cosmetics, toothpaste or reacted with nitric and sulphuric acid to form the explosive nitro-glycerine, glycerol is there.</p>
		<p>Until methanol and ethylene glycol replaced it, it was the 'anti-freeze' for vehicle radiators.</p>
		<p>Apart from being a food grade lubricant for machinery its food uses include; being a solvent for oily chemicals, particularly flavourings; a humectant where its hygroscopic properties help keep food moist and extends shelf-life; controlling the rate of crystallisation in sweets; adding body to a product; and, as a legacy from its anti-freeze days, lowering the freezing point of soft ice creams.</p>
		<p>Vegetarians should note that although industrial manufacturing based on propylene or sugar accounts for a large percentage of glycerol production it can be obtained as a by-product in making soap from animal and vegetable fats and oils.</p>
		<p>NB. the term glycerine is normally applied to commercial products containing more than 95 percent glycerol.</p>

@EverbumDescription@	Sucroglycerides are a mixture of mono- and diesters of sucrose and fatty acids with mono-, di- and triglycerides from fat or oil. It is produced by reacting the sucrose and fat/oil together with or without the presence of a solvent. Usually the solvent is either dimethyl formamide, cyclohexane, isobutanol, isopropanol, or ethyl acetate. It is used as an emulsifier, stabiliser and thickener in many foods. Used in bakery and baked goods, whipping agents, salad dressings, soups, and non-dairy creamers.

		<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="6" color="red"><b><i>E621<br>
					</i></b></font><font size="5" color="red">Monosodium glutamate</font><br>
		</p>
		<p>Often referred to as MSG, Monosodium glutamate is a white crystalline substance, the sodium salt of the amino acid glutamic acid (<a href="http://fake.com/#E620">E620</a>).</p>
		<p>It was first identified as a flavour enhancer in 1908 by Professor Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo University, Japan, who found that soup stocks made from Laminaria japonica (a seaweed which had been added to soups for centuries in Japan), contained high levels of the substance.</p>
		<p>Ikeda decided that the unique taste, which he called <i>umami</i>, (delicious), was so different from the four basic tastes (bitter, salty, sour and sweet) that it was in fact a fifth taste. This view is still widely held although others say it actually only enhances the four basic tastes.</p>
		<p>His discovery led to MSG becoming the first flavour enhancer to be used commercially. Originally production was from seaweed although it is now produced using a bacterial fermentation process with molasses (around 90% of production) or starch (10%) as carbon sources and ammonium salts as nitrogen sources.</p>
		<p>It is found in the majority of savoury foods products, such as broths, soups, flavoured (and occasionally plain) crisps and savoury snacks, flavouring and spice blends, gravies, cooked and cured meats, pork pies, pot noodles, sausages, sauces and in other combinations.</p>
		<p>It is also used to enhance the taste of tobacco and has been used medically to treat hepatic coma.</p>
		<p>MSG is an important ingredient in the cuisines of China and Japan.</p>
		<p>There have been reports that monosodium glutamate may produce in some individuals a wide range of physical reactions including, but not limited to, heart palpitations, migraine, depression, rage and mood swings, anxiety attacks, hyperactivity, burning and tingling sensations, facial tightness or pressure, thirst, cold sweats, dizziness and nausea. The amount of MSG required to cause such reactions seems to vary considerably between individuals, however, for a given individual the trigger amount will not vary significantly.</p>
		<p>The wide range of reported reactions coupled with the varying times of reaction, which can range from almost instantly to up to 48 hours, can help to hide the fact that MSG could be the cause. However, it is reported that although different individuals will react differently, a susceptible individual will react consistently, with the same two or three reactions over the same time scale.</p>
		<p>The substance is naturally present in its bound state, the single amino acid L-glutamic acid, in plant and animal tissues, particularly in fish, meat, milk, poultry and at high levels in tomatoes and Parmesan cheese. It is alleged that it is because, as an additive, it is in a 'free processsed' state, which comprises L-glutamic acid and D-glutamic acid together with a variety of other chemical contaminants, that it gives rise to the reported problems. The contaminants vary depending on the method of manufacture but some, such as mono and dichloro propanols and heterocyclic amines are known to be carcinogenic.</p>
		<p>This hypersensitive reaction, Kwok's disease, first reported by Dr. Robert Ho Man Kwok in 1968, is commonly called &quot;Chinese restaurant syndrome&quot; because cooks in some Chinese restaurants were thought to use MSG extravagantly, (some 20% of production is used in restaurants and hotels). Some Chinese meals have been recorded as containing between 5 and 10g of MSG. It has been suggested by some research that a lack of Vitamin B6 contributes to these MSG symptoms.</p>
		<p>However subsequent studies, including blind tests, have shown no conclusive link between the syndrome and the consumption of normal levels of MSG, around 2g daily, although tests have shown the possibility of brain cell damage in guinea pigs, hamsters, monkeys, rabbits and rats, particularly in the young. Some research appears to show that a lack of calcium appears to exacerbate the damage in adults.</p>
		<p>Also, some research has proposed that as it is an excitotoxin, excessive brain receptor cell activation, caused by too much glutamate, can destroy the cells. It has been further suggested that this could play a part in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntingdon's but the part that dietary glutamates contribute is still controversial. (Excitotoxins are a class of chemicals that can produce brain damage by 'over exciting' neurons into firing their impulses very rapidly until they reach a state of extreme exhaustion. Several hours later these neurons can suddenly die. See also <a href="http://fake.com/#E951">E951</a>)</p>
		<p>Recent Japanese research (October 2002) at Hirosaki University has shown that high levels fed to rats has shown vision loss and retina damage. Although these high levels would not be reached with normal additive levels, there is concern that these same effects could result from the cumulative effect of smaller amounts over a longer period of time. Lead researcher Hiroshi Ohguro says the findings might explain why, in eastern Asia, there is a high rate of normal-tension glaucoma, a form of the eye disease that leads to blindness without the usual increase in pressure inside the eyeball. The higher rate, however, could also be due to genetics.</p>
		<p>Many food manufacturers voluntarily stopped adding MSG to baby foods.</p>
		<p>For those trying to avoid Glutamic acid and its associated glutamates (<a href="http://fake.com/#E620">E620</a>, E621, <a href="http://fake.com/#E622">E622</a>, <a href="http://fake.com/#E623">E623</a>, <a href="http://fake.com/#E624">E624</a>, <a href="http://fake.com/#E625">E625</a>) you should be aware that MSG is in most savoury products (especially convenience foods) and can also be hidden under many names. Anything with the word 'protein' or 'yeast' attached to it such as 'Hydrolysed protein' or 'Autolysed yeast' should be viewed with caution, as should the words 'seasoning' and 'natural flavour'.</p>
		<p>Another pointer towards the possibility of MSG being present under a different name is the use of any of the additives <a href="http://fake.com/#E626">E626</a>, <a href="http://fake.com/#E627">E627</a>, <a href="http://fake.com/#E628">E628</a>, <a href="http://fake.com/#E629">E629</a>, <a href="http://fake.com/#E630">E630</a>, <a href="http://fake.com/#E631">E631</a>, <a href="http://fake.com/#E632">E632</a>, <a href="http://fake.com/#E633">E633</a>, <a href="http://fake.com/#E634">E634</a>, <a href="http://fake.com/#E635">E635</a> (as a quick guide look for the words guanylate or inosinate) as these can be used for their synergistic effects with MSG. For instance a 50/50 mixture of MSG and <a href="http://fake.com/#E626">E626</a> (Guanylic acid) produces a flavour enhancer 100 times more potent than the same amount of MSG alone.</p>
		<p>Just as some manufacturers have started quoting the name rather than the E number, there now seems to be a ploy amongst some manufacturers to arrange the ingredients list to ensure that 'Flavour enhancer' is split and appears on two separate lines so as to be less obvious.</p>

@EverbumDescription@	Aspartame is essentially a non-caloric artificial sweetener which is 160-200 times sweeter than sucrose (sugar), that has a clean sweet taste with slower onset and a prolonged sweet aftertaste. Aspartame is the methyl ester of the dipeptide of the natural amino acids L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine. Lifelong consumption of aspartame probably increases the risk of cancer. Pregnant women should avoid it.

		<p>An intense sweetener synthesised from aspartic acid and phenylalanine.<br>
			<br>
			Aspartame is around 200 times sweeter than sugar, weight for weight.<br>
			<br>
			Originally banned as being carcinogenic it is now allowed. Apart from being found in table top sweeteners (such as Canderel) it can also be found in alcohol-free beer, cider, desserts, fruit juice drinks, tinned or bottled fruits, ice cream, jams, jellies, margarine, marmalades, milk drinks, mustard, sauces, soft drinks and sweets, normally with the description 'no added sugar', 'diet', 'light' or 'lite'.<br>
			<br>
			Aspartame is probably one of the most controversial additives on the market and because of the widely conflicting research, some of which says it is safe and others which give side effects ranging from headaches to death with almost everything in between, establishing the truth is almost impossible.<br>
			<br>
			One part of the research, which does not seem to be disputed, is that during the normal metabolism of Aspartame, the amino acid phenylalanine is released. Around 1 in 10,000 people who suffer the genetic metabolic defect Phenylketonuria (PKU) cannot metabolise phenylalanine and should therefore avoid Aspartame, as an excess of phenylalanine can cause brain damage.<br>
			<br>
			Because of this danger products containing Aspartame have to carry the notice that it is a source of phenylalanine.<br>
			<br>
			The other two products metabolised are aspartic acid (40%) which can cause brain damage in foetuses, and methanol (10%) an alcohol which turns into formaldehyde, a known toxic substance better known as embalming fluid.<br>
			<br>
			A high consensus also seem to agree that Aspartame is an excitotoxin and has a similar effect on the brain as Monosodium glutamate, <a href="http://fake.com/#E621">E621</a> with similar problems. (Excitotoxins are a class of chemicals that can produce brain damage by 'over exciting' neurons into firing their impulses very rapidly until they reach a state of extreme exhaustion. Several hours later these neurons can suddenly die.)<br>
			<br>
			It is further suggested that much of the damage caused is irreversible and that the unborn, the young and old are particularly susceptible to this damage.<br>
			<br>
			Also, researchers from King's College, London are currently investigating the effects of Aspartame to see if it is linked to an increased risk of malignant brain tumours.<br>
			<br>
			Until the truth of the matter is ascertained this is one additive probably best avoided.<br>

		<p>Lactose intolerance, caused by a deficiency of the enzyme lactase, is well documented, but basically in the diet lactose is broken down into its component parts, glucose and galactose, by the enzyme lactase. They are then absorbed from the digestive tract for use by the body. Individuals deficient in lactase cannot metabolise lactose and as unmetabolised lactose cannot be absorbed from the digestive tract it builds up, leading to intestinal distress.</p>
		<p>Commercially lactose is usually prepared by crystallisation, after water evaporation, from whey, a by-product of cheese-making.</p>

@EverbumDescription@	Tannin is a natural colour that is derived from the twigs and nutgalls of oak trees. Commercially it is usually synthetically prepared from acorns. It yields a yellow to white colour. They have many beneficial effects but caution with high concentration. Tannins should be avoided by those suffering from aneamia, as they hinder the absorption of Iron. With the exception of tea, long-term and/or excessive use of herbs containing high concentrations of tannins is not recommended. Tannins are not found on list of EU approved additives but this does not mean they are not allowed in general - simply they are not classifed as food additives but as food ingridients. High concentrations may cause stomach problems or cause constriction of arteries.

@wiki_notConsideredDangerous@	TRUE
@Classification@	Preservative
@FunctionDetails@	It is a colourless gas, used as preservative. It prevents enzymatic and bacterial spoilage of products. Sulphur dioxide dissolves in the aqueous phase of the product; the acid resulting from this reaction is the active agent. It is thus most effective in acid and slightly acid foods. It is ineffective at neutral pH. It also acts as an oxidizing agent, with bleaching effects. It is thus used as a bleaching agent in flour; however, it oxidises (natural) colours in foods, which restricts its usage. Finally, it stabilises vitamin C in products and prevents discoloration of white wine. Heating removes sulphur dioxide as gas from products
@Origin@	Sulphur is a common element. Sulphur dioxide is produced by burning sulphur. Its use as a preservative is associated with ancient history; it had been widely used in ancient Egypt and the Roman Empire
@MyAdditivesDescription@	Colourless, non-flammable gas, with strong, pungent, suffocating odour. Its vapour density is 2.26 times that of air at atmospheric pressure and 0o. The specific gravity of the liquid is about 1.436 at 0o/4o. At 20o the solubility is about 10 g of SO2 per 100 g of solution. It is normally supplied under pressure in containers in which it is present in both liquid and gaseous phases. Caution: Sulfur dioxide gas is intensely irritating to the eyes, throat, and upper respiratory system. Liquid sulfur dioxide may cause skin burns, which result from the freezing effect of the liquid on tissue. Safety precautions to be observed in handling of the material are specified in technical brochures from liquid sulfur dioxide manufacturers, suppliers or organizations of gas manufacturers or suppliers (For example, &#8220;Pamphlet G-3&#8221; published by the Compressed Gas Association, Suite 1004, 1725 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, USA)

@EverbumDescription@	Sulphur dioxide is a colourless gas that is prepared by burning sulphur. Sulphur is naturally occurring in coal and petroleum products. It is highly soluble in water and it's this resultant acid, Sulphurous acid, that imparts its use as a preservative. It's antimicrobial in action which prevents the enzymatic and bacterial spoilage of food, and improves the overall appearance of food, making it look fresher than it might be. Daily Intake: Up to 0.7 mg/kg body weight.  It is known to provoke asthma attacks and is difficult to metabolise for those with impaired kidney function. It also destroys vitamins B1 and E.

@FunctionDetails@	Citric acid and citrates have many functions; they increase the activity of many antioxidants, and exhibit some antioxidant activity. They are mainly used as acidity regulators as well as aroma compounds. They increase gel strength in marmalades and decrease enzymatic browning in fruits and fruit products
@Origin@	Sodium salts of citric acid, a compound found in every living organism, as it is part of the key metabolic pathways in all body cells. Large concentrations are found in citrus fruits, kiwi, strawberries and many other fruits. Commercially prepared by fermentation of molasses with the mould Aspergillus niger 
@MyAdditivesDescription@	
@DietaryRestrictions@	Citric acid and citrates can normally be consumed by all religious groups, vegans and vegetarians. Citric acid does not cause allergic reactions in people who are allergic to oranges and other citrus fruits, as it is commercially made from sugar, not fruits

@EverbumDescription@	Sodium citrate is the sodium salt of citric acid. Commercially it may be produced by the fermentation of carbohydrate solutions, usually molasses or hydrolysed corn starch with Aspergillus niger. Monosodium citrate is a strong sequestrant and is used to prevent clumping in blood samples. Disodium citrate is used as an anti-oxidant, acidity regulator, and sequestrate in foods. Trisoduim citrate is used as a flavour, and preservative in foods. This produces a white crystalline powder which is soluble in water. Citrates does not cause allergic reactions in people who are allergic to oranges and citrus fruits, as it is commercially made from sugar, not fruits. Pseudo-allergic reactions (intolerance) have been reported, but these are very rare.

@EverbumDescription@	Polyphosphates are the salts of sodium, potassium, calcium, and ammonium with phosphates. These are all produced synthetically from their respective carbonates and phosphoric acid, to produce a mineral salt that is used as a stabiliser, acidity regulator, sequestrant, and emulsifier in foods. It is also used to help retain water during processing and storage. Used in many products such as soy milk, pate and processed meats, beer, ice-cream, milk shakes, sweetened condensed milk, sauces and desserts. Daily Intake: Up to 70 mg/kg body weight. High concentrations of phosphates may disturb several metabolic processes as phosphate plays an important role in general metabolism.

@EverbumDescription@	Methyl cellulose is a semi-synthetic polysaccharide with its primary component being the cell walls of green plants and algae. Commercially it can be prepared from wood and cotton. It produces a hydrophilic powder that when dissolved, forms a clear viscous gel used as a thickener, and emulsifier in many foods. Used in many products including bakery products, whipped products and fats, dairy-based drinks, yoghurts, edible ices, batters, breakfast cereals etc. Also used to help produce stable foam in whipped products, better aeration in high fat recipes and other foods. Large concentrations can cause intestinal problems, such as bloating, constipation and diarrhoea.

@EverbumDescription@	Nitrogen is an inert natural gas that is the most abundant in the Earth's atmosphere. It is odourless, colourless, and tasteless. It is used as a packaging gas that displaces oxygen in foods to inhibit the growth of bacteria which cause food spoilage, and to reduce the speed of oxidation. Due to it's low solubility in water, it helps prevent package collapse. It is also used as an aerosol spray propellant.

@EverbumDescription@	Nitrous oxide and water are formed as a result of heating ammonium nitrate at very high temperatures. Nitrous oxide is an inert gas that is odourless and colourless, and is predominately used as a spray can propellant, in particular for whipping cream and cooking oil sprays. It doesn't change the chemical composition of the contents so it's the product of choice. Furthermore it is used as a packaging gas because it inhibits the growth of bacteria, acts as an anti-oxidant and doesn't cause food spoilage. See also <a href="http://fake.com/#E918">E918</a>.
